# GridWorld

The main file is run.m.

The first section of the code will render the GridWorld environment and demonstrate one episode with random inputs.

The agent has the option of four actions:
- Move left
- Move right
- Move up
- Move down

In this first example, the agent randomly selects an action until it reaches a goal space. The states of the environment spaces will be updated as the agent progresses.
