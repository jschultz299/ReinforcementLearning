## Basic Overview

This repository contains various projects displaying Reinforcement Learning Concepts.

#### There are 2 main folders:
- GridWorld (MatLab)
- OpenAiGym (Python)

## GridWorld

This folder contains project files to be run in MatLab.

This project applies Reinforcement Learning principles to solve the GridWorld problem originally developed by the UC Berkely AI Program.

See [GridWorld](https://github.com/jschultz299/ReinforcementLearning/tree/main/GridWorld) for details.

## OpenAiGym

This folder contains Python project files for 3 different Reinforcement Learning Agent-Environments using OpenAi.Gym

See [OpenAiGym](https://github.com/jschultz299/ReinforcementLearning/tree/main/OpenAiGym) for details.
